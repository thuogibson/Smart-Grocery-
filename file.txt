Instructions
In this assessment, you will create your site navigation and a single external CSS file that controls text elements on each of your Web pages.

Complete the following: 

1. Create and save an externally linked, CSS3-compliant style sheet to control all your Web pages (see page list below). It should define properties (such as position, margin, padding, font-family, color, size, et cetera) for each of the following: 
Headlines. 
Header. 
Body text. 
Background (image or color) 
Navigation (use an unordered list to format the list items for navigation). 
Footer (location/font size and color). 
Anchor links (current, hover, visited). 

2. Update the code in your homepage and template to link to the new style sheet. 

3. Use your page template to create the other four pages for the site and title each appropriately:
About Us. 
Services. 
Gallery. 
Contact Us. 

4. Create functional page navigation using CSS. Use textual links using either a horizontal navigation across the top or vertical navigation down the left side. 

5. Define text and background properties for all page elements using CSS. 

6. Make sure to enter context-appropriate text in the content sections for each of the pages to demonstrate that the formatting and design are consistent across the site.

7. Submit error-free HTML5 and CSS code.

Instructions
In this assessment, you will start building your Web site for your fictional organization by creating a homepage using HTML5 and some of the key elements that define a Web page. You are required to use either a simple text editor to write your code, or an enhanced text editor such as Brackets, linked in the Resources under the Suggested Resources heading.

Using a text editor, create an HTML5-compliant homepage with a file name of index.htm. The page should include the following page sections: 

1. Header: Include the organization name and logo. 

2. Navigation: Include links to all site pages (including the homepage). 

3. Content: This section will later be customized for each of the site pages. For the home page, it should, at a minimum, consist of information that introduces the organization. 

4. Footer: Include secondary navigation, copyright notice, or other text of your choosing. 

5. Include the following tags in the code: title, article, section, head, header, html, body, footer, nav, and doctype. 

6. Make sure to include developer comments for each page section to explain or describe the coding.
